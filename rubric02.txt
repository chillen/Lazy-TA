-------------------
Style {5 marks}
__/1  : header comments    0/0.5/1 for none, partial, full comments
__/1  : function comments  0/0.5/1 for none, partial, full comments
__/1  : proper indentation 0/0.5/1 for none, inconsistent, correct
__/1  : proper whitespace  0/0.5/1 for none-too much/inconsistent but ok/good
__/1  : names and other comments 0/0.5/1 poor names-no comments/one good/both good 


Correctness {10 marks}
From auto-marking.  Each test will typically have multiple tests (all are needed for the grade).
__/1  : example(s) from assignment
__/1  : input array length 1 (all 2 possibilities)
__/1  : input array length 2 (all 4 possibilities) 
__/1  : input array length 3 (multiple maximal length streak, all 8 inputs) 
__/1  : small arrays (all true/false, mixed)
__/1  : small arrays (multiple maximal length streaks)
__/1  : midsize arrays (all true/false, mixed)
__/1  : midsize arrays (multiple maximal length streaks)
__/1  : enormous arrays (all true, all false, mixed)
__/1  : enormous arrays (multiple maximal length streaks)

__/2  : user friendly (good prompts, during play and for playing more games)
__/2  : invalid input dealt with (during play and for playing more games)
__/2  : valid game play (cheating not allowed, computer plays are valid)
__/1  : game displayed after every move
__/1  : (correct) summary after all games played
